This project showcases the implementation of a Logistic Regression model using Python to predict customer churn with precision. The workflow covers essential stages such as data exploration, preprocessing, encoding categorical features, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and visualization of performance metrics.

By leveraging powerful libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a predictive model — from raw data to actionable insights. The model’s effectiveness is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring a robust evaluation of performance.

The implementation follows industry-grade machine learning practices, making it an excellent reference for both beginners learning supervised classification and professionals seeking a concise yet comprehensive example of logistic regression in real-world use cases.
